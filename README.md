# Todo App

## Overview

Todo App is a simple task management application built with React.js. This app allows users to add tasks, mark them as complete or incomplete, and save the task list to LocalStorage so that the data persists even after the page is refreshed. Users can also delete tasks that are no longer needed or have been completed.

## Features

- **Add Task**: Users can add new tasks.
- **Delete Task**: Users can remove tasks that are completed or no longer needed.
- **Toggle Task Status**: Users can mark tasks as complete or incomplete.
- **LocalStorage Persistence**: The task list is saved to LocalStorage so that data is preserved across page refreshes.
